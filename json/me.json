    "My name is Ahmed Ibrahim. I have been in the industry for more than 3 years as a Full Stack Developer.",
    "I was a founding member of a team to develop a cross-chain bridge to enable users to move their tokens between different chains easly. I was responsible for building the required infrastructure for it to enable our users to move their tokens between 12 diffirent blockchains. During this time I reduced the average response time for our most imporant APIs from 12s to be just 2s (6x faster).",
    "Then I used this as leverage to go to a bigger organization in Turcky. I was responsible for maintaining a multi-channel chating service in which users can interact with all of their customers  on Twitter and WhatsApp from one place! I was responsible for creating data-collection piplines to analyze and get insights from data then display it to our users in an easy to read graphs. Also I was researching solutions to our deployment issues we had it at the time.",
